% ===============================

In quantum mechanics and mathematical physics, we often work within an inner product space of functions.
A particularly important example is the weighted $L^2$ space:
\[
L^2_w(a,b) = \left\{ f:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R} \, \Big| \,
\int_a^b |f(x)|^2 w(x)\, dx < \infty \right\},
\]
where $w(x) > 0$ is a given \emph{weight function} on $(a,b)$.

\subsection*{Inner Product and Orthogonality}

The inner product between two functions $f$ and $g$ in $L^2_w(a,b)$ is defined by
\[
\langle f, g \rangle = \int_a^b f(x)\, g(x)\, w(x)\, dx.
\]
Two functions are said to be \emph{orthogonal} if $\langle f, g \rangle = 0$.
If, in addition, $\langle f, f \rangle = 1$, then $f$ is said to be \emph{normalized}.
A collection of orthonormal functions $\{\phi_n(x)\}$ satisfies
\[
\langle \phi_m, \phi_n \rangle = \delta_{mn}.
\]
Such systems form the backbone of quantum mechanics:
wavefunctions (or eigenfunctions) of Hermitian operators are orthogonal under an appropriate weight $w(x)$.

\subsection*{Motivation for Orthogonal Polynomials}

The space of polynomials on $(a,b)$ is infinite-dimensional and can be turned into a Hilbert space by introducing an inner product with a suitable weight function.
An \emph{orthogonal polynomial system} $\{p_n(x)\}$ is one that satisfies
\[
\int_a^b p_n(x)\, p_m(x)\, w(x)\, dx = 0, \qquad n \neq m.
\]
These families --- such as Legendre, Hermite, and Laguerre polynomials --- arise naturally as eigenfunctions of self-adjoint differential operators in Sturm--Liouville form,
and therefore also form a complete basis for $L^2_w(a,b)$.

\section*{2. The Gram--Schmidt Orthogonalization Process}
% ===============================

\subsection*{Idea of the Method}

Suppose we start with the sequence of linearly independent monomials:
\[
f_0(x) = 1, \quad f_1(x) = x, \quad f_2(x) = x^2, \quad \dots
\]
and we wish to generate an orthogonal set $\{\phi_n(x)\}$ with respect to some weight $w(x)$ on $(a,b)$.

The Gram--Schmidt process constructs each $\phi_n$ recursively as:
\[
\phi_0 = f_0, \qquad
\phi_k = f_k - \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} 
\frac{\langle f_k, \phi_j \rangle}{\langle \phi_j, \phi_j \rangle}\, \phi_j.
\]
This guarantees orthogonality:
\[
\langle \phi_i, \phi_j \rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all } i \neq j.
\]
If we further normalize each $\phi_n$ by dividing by its norm, we obtain an orthonormal set.

\subsection*{Worked Example: Constructing Legendre Polynomials}

Let us apply the Gram--Schmidt procedure to the monomials $1, x, x^2, \dots$ on the interval $[-1,1]$ with the weight $w(x)=1$.
We define the inner product as
\[
\langle f,g \rangle = \int_{-1}^{1} f(x) g(x)\, dx.
\]

\paragraph{Step 1:} Start with \( f_0(x) = 1 \).
\[
\phi_0(x) = 1, \quad
\langle \phi_0, \phi_0 \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 1 \, dx = 2.
\]
Normalized form:
\[
P_0(x) = \frac{\phi_0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

\paragraph{Step 2:} Next, \( f_1(x) = x \).
Subtract its projection on $\phi_0$:
\[
\langle f_1, \phi_0 \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 x\, dx = 0.
\]
So $\phi_1 = f_1 = x$.
Then
\[
\langle \phi_1, \phi_1 \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 x^2\, dx = \frac{2}{3}.
\]
Normalized:
\[
P_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\, x.
\]

\paragraph{Step 3:} Now \( f_2(x) = x^2 \).
Subtract projections on $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$:
\[
\phi_2 = f_2 - 
\frac{\langle f_2, \phi_0 \rangle}{\langle \phi_0, \phi_0 \rangle}\phi_0
- \frac{\langle f_2, \phi_1 \rangle}{\langle \phi_1, \phi_1 \rangle}\phi_1.
\]
Compute:
\[
\langle f_2, \phi_0 \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 x^2\, dx = \frac{2}{3}, \quad
\langle f_2, \phi_1 \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 x^3\, dx = 0.
\]
Thus
\[
\phi_2 = x^2 - \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Normalize:
\[
\langle \phi_2, \phi_2 \rangle
= \int_{-1}^1 (x^2 - \tfrac{1}{3})^2 dx
= \frac{8}{45}, \quad
P_2(x) = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} (x^2 - \tfrac{1}{3})
= \frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1).
\]

\paragraph{Observation.} 
The resulting $P_0$, $P_1$, and $P_2$ are the first three \textbf{Legendre polynomials}.
Thus, Gram--Schmidt applied to $\{1, x, x^2, \dots\}$ with $w(x)=1$ automatically generates the Legendre family.

\subsection*{Functional--Analytic Interpretation}

This process is equivalent to constructing an orthogonal basis in $L^2[-1,1]$.
Each resulting polynomial $P_n(x)$ is an eigenfunction of a self-adjoint differential operator
\[
\mathcal{L} = \dv{}{x}\!\left[(1-x^2)\dv{}{x}\right].
\]
That is,
\[
\mathcal{L} P_n(x) + n(n+1) P_n(x) = 0.
\]
Hence, Gram--Schmidt gives not only orthogonal functions but also the eigenbasis of $\mathcal{L}$,
showing the deep connection between orthogonalization and operator theory.
